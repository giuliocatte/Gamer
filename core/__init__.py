    TODO LIST:

    - an utility to put an AI versus another, run a thousand of games and give winning stats
    - alpha beta pruning for minimax
    - an AI that combines minimax and neural network (using nn only when the outcome is not clear)
    - when minimax detects a loss ahead, it should play hoping for an opponent error
    - asyncio for running the players simultaneously (in simultaneous games)
    - control of timeouts for AIs
    - chess and go
    - a transformation of a trained neural network in a python function, to copypaste it where I want to use it, without
     the need of tensorflow
