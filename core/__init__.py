    TODO LIST:

    - supervised learning
    - reinforcement learning
    - alpha beta pruning for minimax/negamax
    - an AI that combines minimax and neural network (using nn only when the outcome is not clear)
    - understanding why applying the nn player is so slow (i'd have guessed "training slow but applying fast")
    - when minimax detects a loss ahead, it should play hoping for an opponent error
    - asyncio for running the players simultaneously (in simultaneous games)
    - control of timeouts for AIs
    - go, checkers, backgammon and so on
    - a transformation of a trained neural network in a python function, to copypaste it where I want to use it, without
     the need of tensorflow
    - tests, tests, tests
    - stockfish for chess
    - a GUI
